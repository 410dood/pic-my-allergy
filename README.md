# Pic My Allergy
A website that tells if you are allergic to the food in the picture you have uploaded or linked via URL.

# Idea
I came across Clarifai's public machine learning models and was amazed that the Food model could recognize food down to its ingredient level. This got me thinking about the multitudinous possibilities that this model could be used for.<br />

# Problem that is solved
When you are in a social situation where food is involved and you are not sure who the chef is or whether the food has the thing you are allergic to, most people simply choose not to eat it. This web app solves that problem as the person can go to the website, upload and link an image of the food in front of them and get their answer after entering their allergies and the image URL within seconds.

# Last thoughts
I was curious about machine learning and wanted to create something using Clarifai's Machine Learning API. This project was super fun to work on :D

# Coming soon
An iOS app version of Pic My Allergy where users can snap a picture of the food and find out whether they can eat it or not instantly.
